# osu-bot
 A bot that can believably play the rythm game, osu!


# Getting Started
## 1) Download osu! and locate the User folder
## 2) Extract the contents of User.rar into the User folder


# Using the bot
## Begin key tracking by pressing the numlock key. This start key may be changed in utils.py. Refer to pynput documentation.
## Stop key tracking by pressing the escape key. This key may be changed in utils.py as well
### NOTE: As of right now, every time the bot is restarted using these keys, you MUST restart the python script. This will be resolved in a later fix.
